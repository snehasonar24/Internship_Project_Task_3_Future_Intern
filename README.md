**Iris Dataset Visualization**

This project provides visualizations for the Iris dataset, focusing on understanding the distribution of various numeric features and how they vary across different species of iris flowers. 
The visualizations include histograms and bar charts, which offer insights into the structure and characteristics of the dataset.

**Dataset Description**

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset used in data science and machine learning. It consists of 150 records, each representing an iris flower. The dataset includes the following columns:

* Id: A unique identifier for each entry (not used in analysis).
* SepalLengthCm: The length of the sepal (the outer parts of the flower) in centimeters.
* SepalWidthCm: The width of the sepal in centimeters.
* PetalLengthCm: The length of the petal (the inner parts of the flower) in centimeters.
* PetalWidthCm: The width of the petal in centimeters.
* Species: The species of the iris flower. There are three species in the dataset:
* Iris-setosa
* Iris-versicolor
* Iris-virginica

**Visualizations**

**1. Histograms of Numeric Features**
   
The first set of visualizations includes histograms for the following numeric features:

* SepalLengthCm
* SepalWidthCm
* PetalLengthCm
* PetalWidthCm

These histograms illustrate the distribution of each feature across all iris species. They help identify patterns, skewness, and potential outliers in the data.

**2. Bar Charts of Average Values by Species**

The second set of visualizations consists of bar charts showing the average values of the numeric features, grouped by iris species. These charts help compare how each species differs in terms of sepal and petal dimensions.

The features visualized are:

* Average Sepal Length by Species
* Average Sepal Width by Species
* Average Petal Length by Species
* Average Petal Width by Species
* 
**3. Bar Chart of Species Distribution**
  
The final bar chart presents the distribution of iris species within the dataset. It shows the count of each species, providing an overview of how balanced the dataset is in terms of species representation.

**Conclusion**

These visualizations provide a comprehensive overview of the Iris dataset. The histograms offer insights into the distribution of sepal and petal dimensions, while the bar charts reveal how these features vary across species and how species are distributed within the dataset.
